<!-- This file is the description shown in Rancher Manager when browsing extensions -->
An extension for Rancher Manager which allows you to manage Epinio resources.

After installation, go to the main menu and click on the `Global Apps` / `Epinio` menu item. Rancher Manager will discover Epinio instances and allow you to navigate to them. This experience will be similar, and in places better, than the standalone Epinio UI.

Epinio takes your application from source code to deployment and allow for Developers and Operators to work better together. For more information see https://epinio.io.
