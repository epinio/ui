typeDescription:
  namespaces: Namespaces group your applications, services and other resources. Deleting a namespace will delete all of it's resources.
  applications: Epinio uses Applications to transition your code, through build, to being deployed.
  services: Epinio can create instances of your services. Instances can be bound to your applications to provide data, for example a database service bound to an application might provide connection credentials.
  configurations: Configurations are a way to provide data to applications. The data becomes available once the configuration is bound to them.
  appcharts: Application Charts define kube resources created by your application. Templates for active applications cannot be changed
  catalogservices: Catalog Services provide additional, common functionality to applications. For example an instance of a database Catalog Service can be bound to an application.
