# This patch script is meant to prevent Rancher Shell from looking for schemas
# that are not yet available in the standalone application mode. Since these
# are the only issues with Rancher Shell and Epinio Standalone this script 
# suffices. 

# Grab node command for usage after patch
context=$1

# Currently Rancher Shell looks for schemas that have yet to be loaded, we replace
# the logic safely as we can assume a few things. 
#
# 1. During the setup process the user has already completed the first login.
# 2. Epinio does not require the banner as there is not one in the application. 
# 3. Epinio does not require custom errors as of now.
